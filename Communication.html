      <h2><span class="stage-title">Teams/Slack</span></h2>
      <p>
        In my team, we primarily communicate via Slack. We also use Teams, but
        that is mostly reserved for discussions with people outside of the tech
        team, or for meetings.

      <h2><span class="stage-title">Email</span></h2>
      <p>
        I personally use email for more formal messages, usually involving
        multiple people. I also use email to communicate with individuals
        outside of our organisation.

      <h2><span class="stage-title">Video Call</span></h2>
      <p>
        Video calls are ideal for situations where I need to discuss an issue in
        detail or get immediate feedback. They allow me to ask questions and
        find solutions much faster. Video calls also provide some non-verbal
        communication cues, making conversations smoother.

    <section>
      <h2><span class="stage-title">Face-to-Face</span></h2>
      <p>
        Face-to-face meetings are typically reserved for collaboration and
        sensitive discussions. For team rituals like retrospectives or sprint
        planning, I prefer face-to-face communication as it feels more engaging
        and allows everyone to contribute more effectively.
