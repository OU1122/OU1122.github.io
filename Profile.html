      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I am Ondrej. I'm a passionate Front End Developer based in the
        vibrant city of London. With a background in Web, Frontend & Ecommerce
        Development, I'm all about creating visually stunning and user-friendly
        web experiences that leave a lasting impression. I geek out over modern
        web and e-commerce technologies like JavaScript, React.js, HTML/CSS, and
        Shopify, and I've got a knack for crafting responsive, reusable, and
        lightning-fast user interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        I bring not just technical expertise, but also a passion for design and
        user experience. I thrive in collaborative environments, have a strong
        background in project management, and am committed to delivering
        high-quality solutions while continuously learning and adapting to new
        technologies and industry best practices. Let's build something awesome
        together!

        Expain ways you prefer to communicate and why it's effective. For
        example:
      </p>
      <ul>

          In-person: I like conversation that has a meaning and a purpose. I
          can't hold my attention for prolonger periods of time, but when I do,
          I can communicate effectively and be hyper focused, allowing me to
          understand and resolve any issues quickly.
